            Idk tbh I just code whatever I come up with. I make some cool software and web browsers that TOTALLY aren't
            75% stack overflow code. And just like EA, one project uses code from another. This website is very minimal,
            so <b>if your WiFi sucks your in luck!</b> I could of just not used tailwind, but what fun would that be lame. Btw, who needs favicons. They are just extra bytes!
